### Hi there 👋

* I'm an incoming software engineer at Nike ✔
* I live and breathe iOS, but I also do full stack web as needed 👨🏼‍💻
* I'm most interested in making technology more equitable and accessible through human-centered design ❤️
* My hobbies include playing soccer and creating DJ sets that I perform for my friends 🎧
* Fun fact: I graduated from undergrad when I was 18 years old 👶
